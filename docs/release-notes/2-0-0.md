# Cloakr 2.0 ðŸ¥³

Almost one year after the initial release of Cloakr 1.0.0, we are extremely excited about the release of version 2.0! 
In addition to the release of Cloakr 2.0 as open source software, we have also released Cloakr Pro - a commercial offering of all the latest and greatest Cloakr features on a global network of Cloakr servers.

We have put a ton of effort into this release, making sure that Cloakr stays the best tunneling solution out there - not only for PHP developers.

## New Features

### Dark Mode ðŸŒš

The local Cloakr Dashboard now comes with a beautiful dark mode theme!

### Automatic Subdomain Generation

When sharing a local site explicitly via `cloakr share my-local-site.test`, Cloakr 2 now automatically assigns a static subdomain based on the provided hostname. In this case, Cloakr would try to use the subdomain `my-local-site`. This makes it even easier to always ensure that you use the same subdomain for your Cloakr URLs, even if you do not explicitly provide the custom subdomain yourself.

### TCP Port Sharing

Cloakr 2.0 finally adds the ability to share your local TCP ports with others. This is super useful when you want to give access to an application that is running on your local machine via an Cloakr server.

For exmaple, you can share your local [HELO](https://usehelo.com) instance with others, making it easy to send out emails from staging/production servers right into a desktop application running on your local computer.

### Reserved Subdomains

In Cloakr 1.0 you were already able to specify a custom subdomain that you want to use for your current tunnel. With Cloakr 2.0 you can now ensure that nobody else can use the subdomain besides you (and your team). You can reserve a custom subdomain on an Cloakr server and this subdomain will then be associated with your unique authentication token. 

### Multiple-Server support

Cloakr 1.0 was limited to one server that it could connect to. In case of our free Cloakr server, this would mean that all traffic was going through one server sitting in Frankfurt, Germany. With Cloakr 2.0, you can now define an array of servers that are available for your Cloakr client and then easily switch between those servers using the `--server` command-line argument.

### White-Label Domain support

The 2.0 update of Cloakr finally allowsyou to register a custom white-label domain on the Cloakr servers, allowing you to use your own custom domain with the Cloakr service. This means that you no longer have to share `*.sharedwithcloakr.com` URLs with your colleagues and clients, but you can now register your own domain and use that instead. All it takes is a simple CNAME DNS entry and you're ready to go!
