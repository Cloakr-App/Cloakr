# Setup your authentication token

If you are using our managed Cloakr server infrastructure, you can obtain a free authentication token by [creating an account](https://cloakr.dev/register).

After logging in to Cloakr for the first time, you will see the installation steps for Cloakr, as well as your authentication token.
Copy the command to your clipboard to setup your authentication token.
