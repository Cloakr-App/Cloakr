# Installation

Cloakr can be installed using composer.  
The easiest way to install cloakr is by making it a global composer dependency:

```bash
composer global require beyondcode/cloakr
```

Now you're ready to go and can [share your first site](/docs/cloakr/getting-started/share-your-first-site).

### Extending Cloakr

By default, cloakr comes as an executable PHAR file. This allows you to use all of the cloakr features, like sharing your local sites, out of the box - without any additional setup required.

If you want to modify cloakr, for example by adding custom request/response modifiers, you will need to clone the GitHub repository instead.

You can learn more about how to customize cloakr in the [extending Cloakr](/docs/cloakr/extending-the-server/subdomain-generator) documentation section.
