# Introduction

Cloakr is a beautiful, open source, tunnel application that allows you to share your local websites with others via the internet.

Since you can host the server yourself, you have full control over the domains that your shared sites will be available at.
You can extend cloakr with additional features and middleware classes on the server and client side, to make it suit your specific needs.

Cloakr comes with a beautiful CLI view and web-based dashboard that show you incoming HTTP requests on the client.

Cloakr serves as an alternative to ngrok.
