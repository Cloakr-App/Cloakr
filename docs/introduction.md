# Introduction

Cloakr is an open source tunnel application that allows you to share your local sites and applications with others on the internet.

You can host your own Cloakr server and customize the application to your own needs or create a [free Beyond Code Account](https://beyondco.de/login) and use our managed infrastructure. The managed Cloakr network has a free plan that uses the test infrastrcture in our data center in Germany â€“ and a Pro plan that uses the global Cloakr network with access points in all over the world.

If you decide to host your own server, you can extend Cloakr with additional features and middleware classes on the server and client side. This gives your the full flexibility of true customization but comes with some maintenance overhead.

Cloakr itself comes with a beautiful CLI view and a web-based dashboard that show you incoming HTTP requests on the client.

Cloakr is the alternative to ngrok for PHP developers.
